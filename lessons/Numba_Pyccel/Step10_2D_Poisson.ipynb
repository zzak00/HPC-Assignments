    "The first equation represents mass conservation at constant density. The second equation is the conservation of momentum. But a problem appears: the continuity equation for incompressble flow does not have a dominant variable and there is no obvious way to couple the velocity and the pressure. In the case of compressible flow, in contrast, mass continuity would provide an evolution equation for the density $\\rho$, which is coupled with an equation of state relating $\\rho$ and $p$.\n",

    "In incompressible flow, the continuity equation $\\nabla \\cdot\\vec{v}=0$ provides a *kinematic constraint* that requires the pressure field to evolve so that the rate of expansion $\\nabla \\cdot\\vec{v}$ should vanish everywhere. A way out of this difficulty is to *construct* a pressure field that guarantees continuity is satisfied; such a relation can be obtained by taking the divergence of the momentum equation. In that process, a Poisson equation for the pressure shows up!"
