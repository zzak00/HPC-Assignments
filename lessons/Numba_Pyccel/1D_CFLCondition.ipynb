Initially, the increase in the number of grid points returned more accurate answers.

    "What has happened is that over the time period $\\Delta t$, the wave is travelling a distance which is greater than `dx`.  The length `dx` of each grid box is related to the number of total points `nx`, so stability can be enforced if the $\\Delta t$ step size is calculated with respect to the size of `dx`.  \n",
